				<h1>Pantry Staples</h1>

				<p>From pantry, to cupboards and refrigerator, the following is a list of what you'll find in my kitchen. All pantry and refrigerator items are part of a healthy whole foods diet. Most I have used and can be found within the recipes (use the search bar to the right), some items are used more frequently. As for the equipment I have listed, these are the items that suit my kitchen cooking style and find to be useful. I hope this will encourage you as a guide for your own kitchen and any changes you’re looking to make. Most items are easily accessible and reasonably priced making living a plant based diet easy and affordable. It’s just a matter of pulling together meal plans and routines to suit your lifestyle.</p>

				<p><b>LEGUMES:</b> These are the main proteins in a vegan diet. They are inexpensive and extremely versatile. From hummus (which I eat almost every day), veggie burgers, tacos/burritos, soups, salads, stir fries and even pasta dishes, all types of legumes can be used in various ways creating an endless supply of high protein plant-based meals. Legumes are low in fat, high in protein and fiber and carry essential micronutrients and phytochemicals to keep you at your best. Fresh is best, but canned is great too for those who need a more convenient option.</p>

				<p/><b>CANNED & BOTTLED GOODS:</b> Of course I want you to cook from scratch as much as possible but I also realize that not every one has the desire or time. This is where canned goods can be a great saver of time and energy. Keeping a stocked pantry with some of these essentials means you’ll be able to pull something together. Try to buy bottled items whenever possible and look for BPA free cans.</p>

				<p><b>GRAINS:</b> Grains make for great fillers and main meals. Full of fiber and protein, fuel up with breakfast foods like oatmeal, muesli and quinoa porridge. For the later meals, add a rice of choice, farro or quinoa, ect. to complete your main meals. Many of these are gluten free and should be used as part of a healthy diet.</p>

				<p><b>SPICES:</b> Spices are what will make your meals come alive. I love the simplicity of allowing my vegetables to shine but sometimes I like to use many spices at once to really make a dish as flavorful as possible. I have a large selection in my pantry but find that I usually stick with a few key ones that I love. Use spices to take old recipes and change them up using a different blend. Some I prefer to use fresh like basil, cilantro and parsley while the rest I’m happy to use dried. I recommend purchasing the freshest dried herbs and spices you can find for best flavor!</p>
